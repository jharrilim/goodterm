A replacement for `grep`

## [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

A `cat` clone with syntax highlighting, works great as a pager

A tree-based navigator with support for file previews

## [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)

A solid git UI in the terminal, I don't really use it tbh but it looks cool

> Note: It doesn't support signed commits yet, so I can't use it for commits

A batteries-included shell prompt customizer with great defaults

## [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

A super fast GPU rendered terminal with image support
